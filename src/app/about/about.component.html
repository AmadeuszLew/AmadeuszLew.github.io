    with a background in
    <span class="text-blue-500">Software Development</span>.
    I recently graduated from the esteemed Adam Mickiewicz University, where I completed my senior year and <span
      class="text-blue-500">earned my engineering degree.</span>
    Since December 1, 2023, I have been employed as an <span class="text-blue-500">Angular Developer</span>,

  <p class="section-paragraph mt-0 width-100">I have a deep passion for programming as it allows me to unleash my
    creativity and bring new ideas to life.
    My primary focus lies in front-end development, where I specialize in various technologies such as HTML, CSS,
    JavaScript, TypeScript,
    Bootstrap, Tailwind, Angular, and even have some experience with Vue.
    Alongside my programming journey, I have also worked as a network specialist in the IT industry.
    However, my true joy and fulfillment lie in the realm of coding, where I can explore endless possibilities and
    continually evolve my skills.</p>
