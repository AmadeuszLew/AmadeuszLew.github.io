  <h2 class="secondary-title">About me</h2>
    <h6 class="mt-2 text-white">
      Greetings! My name is <span class="text-teal-400">Amadeus</span>, and I am a seasoned IT professional
      with a background in <span class="text-yellow-400">Software Development</span>.
      I recently graduated from the esteemed Adam Mickiewicz University, where I
      <span class="text-yellow-400">earned my engineering degree</span>.
      Since December 1, 2023, I have been employed as a developer, starting as an
      <span class="text-cyan-400">Angular Developer</span> and growing into a
      <span class="text-cyan-400">full-stack role</span>.
      <br />
      Currently, I specialize in <span class="text-orange-400">Java EE</span> and contribute to a
      <span class="text-green-400">large-scale core project</span> that serves as the foundation for various
      customer implementations. My primary focus is on a solution developed for
      <span style="color: #ED1C24;">Swiss Life</span>, though my journey began with contributions to the
      <span style="color: #005BBB;">AXA site</span>. These experiences have honed my skills in both
      <span class="text-cyan-400">frontend and backend development</span>, enabling me to tackle diverse challenges
      in the realm of web application development.
      <br />
      Thank you for visiting my personal page!

      I have a deep passion for programming as it allows me to unleash my creativity and bring new ideas to life.
      Over the years, my expertise has grown to encompass both <span class="text-cyan-400">frontend</span> and
      <span class="text-orange-400">backend</span> development, enabling me to work on
      <span class="text-green-400">large-scale core projects</span> that have a real-world impact.
      My primary focus includes technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, TypeScript, Tailwind, Angular, and Java EE,
      while also having experience with frameworks like Bootstrap and Vue.
      <br />
      Beyond development, Iâ€™ve also worked as a network specialist in the IT industry, gaining valuable insights into
      system infrastructure. However, my true joy lies in coding, where I explore endless possibilities, collaborate with
      talented teams, and continually evolve my skills to tackle new challenges.
